[Notes]
• If an image won’t update on the wall, purge that object in DO → CDN → Purge.
• Keep images ≤1 MB; 1920×1080–2560×1440.
• Use lowercase, hyphenated filenames; avoid spaces.
• Order control = paste image-list.txt URLs into DAKboard “Custom URL(s)”.
• Folder rotation (no order control) = just point to /dakboard/.
• Text on the board: #C5A76C only (matte), no glows, Helvetica Now Condensed Light.
